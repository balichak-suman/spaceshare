\newpage
\begin{abstract}
SpaceShare: Cloud Storage Under Blockchain is a modern web application that allows users to securely upload files, log uploads on the blockchain, authenticate via OTP (email), and interact with MetaMask. The backend is built with Flask and MongoDB, the blockchain logic uses Solidity and Hardhat, and the UI is modern and responsive.

This project demonstrates the integration of decentralized and centralized technologies for secure file management. Users authenticate via OTP sent to their email, upload files that are stored in MongoDB, and each upload is logged on the Ethereum blockchain using a custom Solidity smart contract. MetaMask is used for wallet authentication and transaction signing, ensuring transparency and user control.

The frontend features a modern, responsive UI with animated transitions and a direct link to the project repository. The backend is built with Flask, using SendGrid for email, and ngrok for secure public access during development. The blockchain component is managed with Hardhat, and all code is open source.

SpaceShare is designed for security, transparency, and ease of use, making it a model for future decentralized file management systems.

%================= NEW CHAPTERS AND EXPANSIONS =========================

\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}
\section{Background}
The evolution of file storage has transitioned from local, device-based storage to cloud-based and now decentralized solutions. Early systems relied on physical media, while modern approaches leverage distributed networks and blockchain for enhanced security and transparency.

\section{Related Work}
Several projects and platforms have explored secure file storage and blockchain integration, such as IPFS, Filecoin, and Storj. These systems focus on decentralization, but often lack seamless user authentication or easy integration with web technologies. SpaceShare builds upon these ideas, offering a user-friendly, hybrid approach.

\chapter{METHODOLOGY}
\section{System Architecture}
The SpaceShare system is composed of three main layers: frontend, backend, and blockchain. The frontend provides the user interface, the backend manages file storage and authentication, and the blockchain logs file uploads for transparency.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./architecture}
    \caption{SpaceShare System Architecture}
\end{figure}

\section{Workflow}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item User registers and authenticates via OTP (email).
    \item User uploads a file through the frontend.
    \item Backend stores the file in MongoDB GridFS.
    \item Backend triggers a blockchain transaction to log the upload.
    \item User can view, download, or delete files; all actions are logged.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Security Measures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item OTP-based authentication for user verification.
    \item MetaMask integration for blockchain transaction signing.
    \item Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS).
    \item Access control for file operations.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{TESTING AND VALIDATION}
\section{Testing Strategy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Unit testing for backend API endpoints.
    \item Integration testing for file upload/download and blockchain logging.
    \item User acceptance testing for UI/UX.
\end{itemize}

\section{Sample Test Cases}
\begin{longtable}{|p{0.5\textwidth}|p{0.4\textwidth}|}
\caption{Sample Test Cases for SpaceShare} \\
\hline
\textbf{Test Case} & \textbf{Expected Result} \\
\hline
Upload valid file & File is stored and logged on blockchain \\
\hline
Upload unsupported file type & Error message displayed \\
\hline
Invalid OTP entry & Authentication fails \\
\hline
MetaMask not connected & Blockchain logging fails gracefully \\
\hline
\end{longtable}

\chapter{SECURITY ANALYSIS}
\section{Threat Model}
Potential threats include unauthorized access, data interception, and blockchain transaction spoofing. SpaceShare mitigates these through OTP, MetaMask, and encrypted channels.

\section{Vulnerabilities and Mitigations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Phishing:} User education and MetaMask warnings.
    \item \textbf{Replay Attacks:} OTPs are single-use and time-limited.
    \item \textbf{Data Breach:} Files are stored per-user and access-controlled.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{USER GUIDE}
\section{Getting Started}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Register with your email and verify using the OTP sent.
    \item Connect your MetaMask wallet.
    \item Upload files using the intuitive UI.
    \item View, download, or delete your files.
    \item All uploads are transparently logged on the blockchain.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Troubleshooting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{OTP not received:} Check spam folder or request a new OTP.
    \item \textbf{MetaMask issues:} Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked.
    \item \textbf{File upload errors:} Check file size/type and internet connection.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{APPENDIX}
\section{Glossary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{OTP:} One-Time Password
    \item \textbf{MetaMask:} Browser-based Ethereum wallet
    \item \textbf{GridFS:} MongoDB file storage system
    \item \textbf{Solidity:} Smart contract programming language
\end{itemize}

\section{Additional Figures}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{./mlrit_logo}
    \caption{MLRIT Logo}
\end{figure}

\section{Sample User Session}
\begin{verbatim}
1. User opens SpaceShare and registers with email.
2. Receives OTP and enters it to authenticate.
3. Connects MetaMask wallet.
4. Uploads a file; sees confirmation and blockchain log.
5. Downloads or deletes file as needed.
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK}
\section{Conclusion}
SpaceShare successfully demonstrates the integration of secure file upload, blockchain-based logging, and user-centric authentication. The project provides a robust, transparent, and user-friendly platform for file management, leveraging both centralized and decentralized technologies.

\section{Future Work}
Future enhancements may include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Integration with IPFS for decentralized file storage
  \item Enhanced access control and sharing features
  \item Support for additional blockchain networks
  \item Improved analytics and audit trails
\end{itemize}
